// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

//I'm writing here programme to learn what is comment in programme and how we use it in our programe:

let name: string = "umair";
console.log(name);

//Another Programme:

let yourName: string = "Sir Zia";
console.log(yourName);

//if we want to comment line from 14 to 19 than we will use /* */:

/* 
let whitespaceName: string = "\t  Umair Idrees  \n";
console.log("Whitespace_Name:" + whitespaceName);


let strippedName: string = whitespaceName.trim();
console.log("stripped_Name: " + strippedName);
