// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendsName: string[] = [
  "Aziz",
  "Zeshan",
  "Abbas",
  "Talha",
  "Luqman",
  "Umer",
];
console.log("I enjoy when I meet you :" + friendsName[0]);
console.log("I enjoy when I meet you :" + friendsName[1]);
console.log("I enjoy when I meet you :" + friendsName[2]);
console.log("I enjoy when I meet you :" + friendsName[3]);
console.log("I enjoy when I meet you :" + friendsName[4]);
console.log("I enjoy when I meet you :" + friendsName[5]);
